Westford Academy GPA Calculator

This is a GPA calculator that follows regulation & protocol from the official GPA Calculation Worksheet(tinyurl.com/mry5zsek) published by Westford Public Schools.

To use the GPA Calculator, first either install Go from go.dev/dl, or use an online Go Compiler. 

Version 1 gives a basic output, but Version 2 prints all of the inputted data into a table that includes classes entered, grades entered, etc. Version 2 is recommended, but either version can be used. 

This is a work in progress repository, so I might add more features that I find useful. If you have any ideas to add to this, feel free to let me know and submit a pull request.
